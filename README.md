# Tab-Dupectonomy
Original version taken from: https://code.google.com/archive/p/tab-dupectomy/ by alex.mcmorris

Not that complicated... it removes duplicate tabs from the current window.

If you tend to open lots of tabs at the same site this extension will help clean up any duplicates. For example, browsing source code or API documentation, getting lost in a social network, following cyclic wiki article references, or any number of other self referential data sources. Many times we open links in new tabs not remembering that we already had.
